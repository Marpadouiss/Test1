I think that is the success that drives away the people. I have the impression that the success frightens some people. I often feel that people are trying to put myself in a box. They have known me before as someone simple and normal. But as they see me in the clips, surjouer or play roles, they think that I am eaten up by it. While I am just doing my job.

Always in as before, you say "I leave you believe that I changed". But est- this not normal in the life of a man to change the point of view, of a daily newspaper and therefore associates?

This is quite normal and I say all the time. And I say precisely "I leave you believe that I have tight". "Tighten" in Marseillais it means "crazy". I say to them it and after for the taunt I told them "Yes I am become crazy." crazy to work.


How you would describe your relationship with Jul with which thou hast asked on the song "They know"?

Our reports are human and very sincere. It is not called all days but when one sees for clips, for the music, this are always good times. Even if we do not have the same age, it is someone who has in the head despite what one believes. Our musical moments are always simple and magical.



It is Jul who recorded the song. Why?

Author, composer, performer and sound engineer (Laughs)! After when it is up to me to save, he calls me and hop! Everything is folded. I have never seen it in 20 years of career. Same Akhenaton I have never seen it. It is a dinguerie! This guy is a genius. I told him ten billion times and he knows it.

It is necessary that tu m'explain a trick. How we have arrived today to make people dance in the box on the "flies, it Braque, it wind of shit etc.."

It bursts of laughter. There are so many galleys in life, that if people can forget everything for five minutes and listen to the good sound, they do. French rap in gearbox, it works like never before. People need to sing the lyrics, dancing and sometimes even when it is not a trick dancing, the song happening when the same. For example, my title finished the, does not lend itself to the club and yet he has market.




That is what you think of a guy as SCH?

It was still not made of feat together but it is someone who is on my label, i crossed several times. I appreciate humanely and musically because it made the SCH. To me it looks like nothing else. It brings a renewal to a rap Marseillais who was beginning to become a little homogeneous I say not that there was all the same but we had the codes that we accede. SCH, It is a new card in the game of rap Marseillais and it makes me happy. I saw his figures, all the merit is for him and his team. Can be, a feat a day, we will see. It never say never.

You love the darkness of this artist?

I like very much. If you knew everything that I am listening. I listen to the same of the rock. You know, it was necessary to draw and if you listen to that of the rap, at a given time, you're going round in circles.

You say: "We are the reflection of a capitalist society". There is not a paradox between the fact of criticizing the system and the fact to make the apology with the marks, the money?

Yeah, that is true. There is a paradoxical side of crazy. I am aware of and I assume. Unfortunately, there has grown up with nothing therefore to each time that it was a minimum, we want to show. As if it was a trophy, as if we were going to the more we abide because today I have a Audemars Piguet for the wrist. And this is what I am aware of that. I have been critical of the system but I am his reflection. It is my fault and it is not my fault at the same time. Life is like that and unfortunately I am not in cache not. There is a weak one tries all days to strengthen our hearts and our desires but I am not an example to follow. All days and I leave in question. When I say: "We are the reflection of a capitalist society," it is the truth. Today, there are kids dressed more expensive than their teachers: their mothers kill themselves to the task for the dress. And it will be worse and worse with the generations to come… it is unfortunately as that we has lived and if we can transmit new values to our children… Me I am not a superhero. The more important it is to transmit.

How thou t AM with thy children for instilling these values?

I tell them that everything is merit in life, that the habit does not make the monk. It is nice to dress up but there has values more important. I urge them even to document on the religions, I say "the" religions because we are Muslims but I want them to do their own idea of the faith. It is very important.

In speaking of criticism of the system, it's been months that one begins to see the revolts that we had not the usual to see these last few months. That is--ce that it inspires when you see this youth in the street, the police violence that was unleashed and the intransigence of the State?

It was to be expected. Simply. At a given time, the act work, the other (Sarkozy) which we bassinait with the "work more to earn more" , we cannot ask the impossible to the youth of today. Our society is the brothel. Ca not surprise me of everything that happens. Ca is a bit the name of the album of SCH (ndlr: anarchy).



And the police violence, it does surprise you not?

Not. The police are human beings, they can also have moments of weakness. They do not feel supported by the Government. That is what they say. Because it sends them to the Gachon against an entire people. It is a little logic. It was to be expected because the promises are not held, because it is governed by people who want the power but which appear to fuck of the people. If today, there are people who do not vote is that nobody understands the political programs. For my part, I feel not represented and I do not understand their programs, I do not see where they want to come. May be that it is necessary that the policies use words more simple. It does nothing to hand that we must vote for them.

The victory of the real in the Champions League, it has marked thee who es fan of the club?

Yeah, that is true. There is a paradoxical side of crazy. I am aware of and I assume. Unfortunately, there has grown up with nothing therefore to each time that it was a minimum, we want to show. As if it was a trophy, as if we were going to the more we abide because today I have a Audemars Piguet for the wrist. And this is what I am aware of that. I have been critical of the system but I am his reflection. It is my fault and it is not my fault at the same time. Life is like that and unfortunately I am not in cache not. There is a weak one tries all days to strengthen our hearts and our desires but I am not an example to follow. All days and I leave in question. When I say: "We are the reflection of a capitalist society," it is the truth. Today, there are kids dressed more expensive than their teachers: their mothers kill themselves to the task for the dress. And it will be worse and worse with the generations to come… it is unfortunately as that we has lived and if we can transmit new values to our children… Me I am not a superhero. The more important it is to transmit.

How thou t AM with thy children for instilling these values?

I tell them that everything is merit in life, that the habit does not make the monk. It is nice to dress up but there has values more important. I urge them even to document on the religions, I say "the" religions because we are Muslims but I want them to do their own idea of the faith. It is very important.

In speaking of criticism of the system, it's been months that one begins to see the revolts that we had not the usual to see these last few months. That is--ce that it inspires when you see this youth in the street, the police violence that was unleashed and the intransigence of the State?

It was to be expected. Simply. At a given time, the act work, the other (Sarkozy) which we bassinait with the "work more to earn more" , we cannot ask the impossible to the youth of today. Our society is the brothel. Ca not surprise me of everything that happens. Ca is a bit the name of the album of SCH (ndlr: anarchy).



And the police violence, it does surprise you not?

Not. The police are human beings, they can also have moments of weakness. They do not feel supported by the Government. That is what they say. Because it sends them to the Gachon against an entire people. It is a little logic. It was to be expected because the promises are not held, because it is governed by people who want the power but which appear to fuck of the people. If today, there are people who do not vote is that nobody understands the political programs. For my part, I feel not represented and I do not understand their programs, I do not see where they want to come. May be that it is necessary that the policies use words more simple. It does nothing to hand that we must vote for them.

The victory of the real in the Champions League, it has marked thee who es fan of the club?
I think that is the success that drives away the people. I have the impression that the success frightens some people. I often feel that people are trying to put myself in a box. They have known me before as someone simple and normal. But as they see me in the clips, surjouer or play roles, they think that I am eaten up by it. While I am just doing my job.

Always in as before, you say "I leave you believe that I changed". But est- this not normal in the life of a man to change the point of view, of a daily newspaper and therefore associates?

This is quite normal and I say all the time. And I say precisely "I leave you believe that I have tight". "Tighten" in Marseillais it means "crazy". I say to them it and after for the taunt I told them "Yes I am become crazy." crazy to work.


How you would describe your relationship with Jul with which thou hast asked on the song "They know"?

Our reports are human and very sincere. It is not called all days but when one sees for clips, for the music, this are always good times. Even if we do not have the same age, it is someone who has in the head despite what one believes. Our musical moments are always simple and magical.



It is Jul who recorded the song. Why?

Author, composer, performer and sound engineer (Laughs)! After when it is up to me to save, he calls me and hop! Everything is folded. I have never seen it in 20 years of career. Same Akhenaton I have never seen it. It is a dinguerie! This guy is a genius. I told him ten billion times and he knows it.

It is necessary that tu m'explain a trick. How we have arrived today to make people dance in the box on the "flies, it Braque, it wind of shit etc.."

It bursts of laughter. There are so many galleys in life, that if people can forget everything for five minutes and listen to the good sound, they do. French rap in gearbox, it works like never before. People need to sing the lyrics, dancing and sometimes even when it is not a trick dancing, the song happening when the same. For example, my title finished the, does not lend itself to the club and yet he has market.




That is what you think of a guy as SCH?

It was still not made of feat together but it is someone who is on my label, i crossed several times. I appreciate humanely and musically because it made the SCH. To me it looks like nothing else. It brings a renewal to a rap Marseillais who was beginning to become a little homogeneous I say not that there was all the same but we had the codes that we accede. SCH, It is a new card in the game of rap Marseillais and it makes me happy. I saw his figures, all the merit is for him and his team. Can be, a feat a day, we will see. It never say never.

You love the darkness of this artist?

I like very much. If you knew everything that I am listening. I listen to the same of the rock. You know, it was necessary to draw and if you listen to that of the rap, at a given time, you're going round in circles.
